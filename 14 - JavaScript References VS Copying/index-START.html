    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team2 = players.slice();
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now here is the problem!
    team4[3] = 'heeee haw';
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    const cap3 = {...person};

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
